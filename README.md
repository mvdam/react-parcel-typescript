## Bootstrap a React TypeScript project with Parcel Bundler
> With zero configuration<sup>*</sup>

Starting up a new project can be quite intensive. Most time will vanish in setting up the build process. We all know the pains of setting up Webpack with loaders and configuration files. But things might have changed. Since December 2017, Parcel Bundler was released!

#### But why Parcel?
Parcel claims to be a `Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler`. That all sounds nice, but does it really work out of the box for the modern web applications we are building today? Lets setup some requirements for our application;

* Modern JavaScript framework (React)
* TypeScript for some typesafeness
* CSS Modules
* Other assets like images and fonts

#### Lets get started!

1. Create a new folder -> `mkdir myApp; cd myApp`
2. Create a new package.json file -> `npm init -y`
